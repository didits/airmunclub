       AIRMUN Club is a platform for all students who has concerns on international issues such as politics, diplomacy, international business, law, and human rights to gather and exchanging ideas regarding those matters. Our community aim to give the same opportunity and space to all students to improve their public speaking ability, expressing their ideas on international issues, and furthermore, to participate as a delegate represents Universitas Airlangga on national and international MUN conference such as Harvard National Model United Nations (HNMUN), Harvard World Model United Nations (Harvard WMUN), Asia-Pacific Model United Nations Conference (AMUNC), Jakarta Model United Nations (JMUN), and many more.
                 <br /> <br />
                 Students joining our community are not only able to participate as a delegate in any MUN conference but also having responsibility for spreading the spirit of MUN through Airlangga School of Diplomacy (ASOD) which organized and held annually by our members. The aim of ASOD is to widespread anything related to MUN for those who do not thoroughly understand the mechanism of MUN, and indirectly encouraged others to have the same concerns as we do on international issues. 
<br /> <br />
                 ASOD itself would enable our members to practice and improve their MUN skills through direct and real conference beside daily training and debate practice, improve their organization skills, and giving chances to build networks with other MUNers. Furthermore, our community would not only benefit members but also students outside of our community to further acknowledge the importance of diplomacy and public speaking skills.
